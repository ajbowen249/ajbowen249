Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer with a wide array of interests, from games to embedded to web and mobile apps. Check out my full portfolio [here!](https://ajbowen249.github.io/portfolio/).

## Project Highlights

### `lait`

![lait-meta-card](https://github.com/ajbowen249/portfolio/blob/main/public/lait-meta-card.png?raw=true)

Looking to do some text processing with a tool like `awk`, but can't remember the syntax or what builtins your specific distribution has? Do you know JavaScript or TypeScript? If so, look no further than [`lait`](https://ajbowen249.github.io/lait/)! `lait` is an `npm` tool that can process files on the command line using some special syntactical tricks to give `awk`-like hooks to a TypeScript or JavaScript snippet.

### Tandy TRS-80 Model 100 and ZX Spectrum "Demake" of Baldur's Gate III

Want to play the latest popular RPG, but don't have a modern system? Well, I can't *really* help you, but you can play this piece of interactive fanart I built that reimagines the first act of the game for two systems from the 80's! Head [here](https://github.com/ajbowen249/mol) to check it out for yourself! You can also read the article on [PCGamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-laptops/this-8-bit-demake-of-baldurs-gate-3-was-made-for-a-40-year-old-laptop-and-its-a-massive-shot-of-pure-1980s-gaming-nostalgia/), or watch this YouTube video for a full breakdown of how it works:

If you'd like to make your own SRD-compatible game for these systems, I built the [Dungeon Delver Engine](https://github.com/ajbowen249/dungeon-delver-engine) as the basis for this and future projects.

### Bleckers

If you're looking for something simple, it doesn't get much simpler than Checkers! This was implemented to familiarize myself with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), .NET's reactive frontend library. Thanks to GitHub Pages, you can play a live build [right here](https://ajbowen249.github.io/Bleckers/).
